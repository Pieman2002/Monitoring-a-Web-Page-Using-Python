# Monitoring-a-Web-Page-Using-Python

In order to use this file, **you need a python file named "varsScrape.py" with 4 variables defined. Your Twilio authentication token (call it auth_token), the Twilio account SID (call it acount_sid), and two phone numbers. One phone number should be the one from Twilio (called twilio_phone_number) and the other should be your own (called my_phone_number).**

This file, as of right now, DOES NOT WORK.

Scrape.py scrapes a defined page in the chosen interval of seconds for the chosen amount of times. (So the three parameters are the site URL, the interval between checks, and the amount of checks.)

All of the html on the page is compared using two files. While it can copy the information to the files, it is unable to compare those files.
